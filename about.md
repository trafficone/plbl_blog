# About

This is a personal site where I share information about my projects, research, and adventures.
Updates infrequent, all opinions my own. All images Copyright by author unless specified otherwise.


## Bio

I am an engineer with an interest in horticulture, botany, and bioinformatics. I write infrequently in this
space to describe the things I find interesting, and share my personal projects.
My interests are varied, so topics will range from amateur radio to ancient history. I particularly
like plants, but no promises.

I've lived in the Pacific Northwest for 10 years, 6 in Portland, OR and 4 in Seattle, WA. I've
worked at tech companies almost all of my professional life, and programmed recreationally for 
almost all of my adult life. 
I've been married to my beautiful wife since 2011.

## Contact 

I'm not sure we're close enough for that.
Please fax a contact request form to +1 (480) 203.1400

Be sure to include the method you wish to be contacted by, your name (or handle), and why 
you want me to reach out. I don't respond to every fax I receive, but I certainly read all of them.

If you are unable to send a fax, contact me on Twitter @Trafficone
