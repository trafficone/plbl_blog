# About

This is a personal site where I share information about my projects, research, and adventures.
Updates infrequent, all opinions my own. All images Copyright by author unless specified otherwise.


## Bio

I am a research student with an interest in horticulture, botany, and bioinformatics. 
I write infrequently in this space to describe the things I find interesting, 
and share my personal projects.
My interests are varied, so topics will range from amateur radio to ancient history. 

I currently live in Tokyo, Japan. 
I've lived in the Pacific Northwest for 10 years, 6 in Portland, OR and 4 in Seattle, WA. I've
worked at tech companies almost all of my professional life, and programmed recreationally for 
almost all of my adult life. 
I've been married to my beautiful wife since 2011.
